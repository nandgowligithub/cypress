Cypress Project Implementation

This project assumes node is installed on the machine.
Clone the prjoect and execute **npm run cypress:test:result** this ll install all the dependencies and provdes the result path at the end of execution.

For API tests, basic flow of code is written and validated falsly, just to show the implementation intent.
